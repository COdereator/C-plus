Data Abstraction in C++
Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the outside world and hiding the internal details,
 i.e., representing only the essential details in the program.
Data Abstraction is a programming technique that depends on the seperation of the interface and implementation details of the program.
Let's take a real life example of AC, which can be turned ON or OFF, change the temperature, change the mode, 
and other external components such as fan, swing. But, we don't know the internal details of the AC, i.e., how it works internally.
 Thus, we can say that AC seperates the implementation details from the external interface.
C++ provides a great level of abstraction. For example, pow() function is used to calculate the power of a number without knowing
 the algorithm the function follows.
